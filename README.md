### R Programming 📊
R is a programming language and environment specifically designed for statistical computing and graphics. It provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, making it a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization. R is open-source, meaning that it's freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.

### Power BI 📈
Microsoft Power BI is a user-friendly business analytics tool, facilitating data visualization and insights sharing. With a diverse array of visualization options, it connects to different data sources, offering data modeling and advanced analytics. As part of the Microsoft Power Platform, Power BI enhances decision-making by transforming raw data into compelling, shareable visuals.

### Excel 📑
Microsoft Excel is great for projects because it easily reads CSV files. It helps organize, and show data in tables, making it super useful for things like reading data in different areas.


## Getting Started 🚀
You will need a PC with Microsoft Windows Installed as Microsoft Power BI is only compatible with Window's PC's.


Install R Studio, go to their website at rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and download the software. Once downloaded, install it, and open R Studio. In R Studio, install important packages by typing and running these commands in the console:
