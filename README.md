To analyze the performance of Hollywood movies released 2007-2012.

## Project Description

Exploring the world of Hollywood movies from 2007 to 2012 with our project, "Hollywood Movie Trends Analysis." We use R Programming and Microsoft Power BI to dive deep into the movies of that time, uncovering interesting insights and trends.

## **Technologies Used**

List the technologies and tools you used in your project:

### R Programming
R is a programming language and environment specifically designed for statistical computing and graphics. It provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, making it a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization. R is open-source, meaning that it's freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.

### Power BI
Microsoft Power BI is a user-friendly business analytics tool, facilitating data visualization and insights sharing. With a diverse array of visualization options, it connects to different data sources, offering data modeling and advanced analytics. As part of the Microsoft Power Platform, Power BI enhances decision-making by transforming raw data into compelling, shareable visuals.

### Excel
Microsoft Excel is great for projects because it easily reads CSV files. It helps organize, and show data in tables, making it super useful for things like reading data in different areas.
